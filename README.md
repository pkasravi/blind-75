# blind-75

This repository is meant to follow the famous Blind 75 list of LeetCode questions to study for technical interviews.

The goal is to have well documented solutions for all of the problems in addition to some documentation for common patterns.

# grind-75

You'll notice that the repository also has a grind-75 folder. This is because I wanted to store Grind75 problems in the same repo without changing the name of the repo. Ah _naming_, the bane of every software engineer's existence...
